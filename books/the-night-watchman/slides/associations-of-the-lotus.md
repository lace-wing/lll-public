# Yu's Associations of <span style="--mo:lotus">Lotus</span>

---

Still so <span style="--mo:credulous">credulous</span> am I, now young no more,
So credulous of
Beauty. I wish to kneel to the <span style="--mo:lotus">lotus</span> pond.

---

<span style="--mo:credulous">credulous</span>
> Too willing to believe what you are told and so easily deceived.

---

Now <span style="--mo:narcissus">Narcissus</span> dies thirsty in Greece:
On <span style="--mo:byron">Byron</span>'s tomb
Crows are quarreling over a dead <span style="--mo:cicada">cicada</span>.

---

<span style="--mo:narcissus">Narcissus</span>
> From Greek mythology. A beautiful hunter who fell in love with his reflection in a pool of water.

<span style="--mo:byron">Byron</span>

<span style="--mo:cicada">Cicada</span>
> A family of sound-producing insects, found in tropical and temperate areas worldwide.

---

War stops not at <span style="--mo:hemingway">Hemingway</span>'s death.
Still men are fond
Of writing their diaries in the light of <span style="--mo:mars">Mars</span>.

---

<span style="--mo:hemingway">Hemingway</span>
> An American novelist, short-story writer and journalist, was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature, died of suicide in 1961, while the Cold War ended 30 years later.

<span style="--mo:mars">Mars</span>
> The 4th planet in the Solar System,
named after Mars, the Roman god of war.

---

A fashionable cancer is <span style="--mo:nihilism">Nihilism</span>.
When evening comes,
Many soul takes leave of its flesh.

---

<span style="--mo:nihilism">Nihilism</span>
> A belief that all political and religious organizations are bad, or a system of thought that says
that there are no principles or beliefs that have any meaning or can be true.

---

Yet mine <span style="--mo:divorce">divorces</span> me not. Here it stays
With every lotus,
Watchful over its <span style="--mo:cosmos">cosmos</span> and mystery.

---

<span style="--mo:divorce">Divorce</span>
> To separate two subjects.

<span style="--mo:cosmos">Cosmos</span>
> Universe.
The idea of 'every flower/leaf holds a world' has various origins, most famously, Buddhism.
    >> To see a World in a Grain of Sand
    And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
    â€”William Blake

---

And all at once very near and far is the East.
With Buddha in you,
The lotus flowers form a <span style="--mo:lotus-seat">divine seat</span>.

---

<span style="--mo:lotus-seat">Lotus Seat</span>
> The lotus throne, sometimes called lotus platform, is a stylized lotus flower used as the seat or base for a figure in art associated with Indian religions.

---

Look! Graceful are the flowers, cool the leaves!
You can visualize
Beauty within them, and <span style="--mo:deity">Deity</span> above,

---

<span style="--mo:deity">Deity</span>
> A god or goddess.

---

And me beside, and me between, I'm the dragon-fly.
Dust is in the wind,
And powder. They need wiping, my weeping eyes.
